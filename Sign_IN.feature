   When the standard user signs in with username "standard_user" and password "secret_sauce"
   Then they should be logged in successfully

  When the locked_out_user signs in with username "locked_out_user" and password "secret_sauce"
  Then they should see the message with the text: "Sorry, this user has been locked out"
